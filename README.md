Hospital readmission prediction using machine learning (ML) techniques is a healthcare-focused application of data science and artificial intelligence. It involves developing predictive models to forecast whether a patient who has been discharged from a hospital will be readmitted within a certain time frame, typically within or after 30 days of their initial discharge.
Common ML algorithms used for hospital readmission prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
